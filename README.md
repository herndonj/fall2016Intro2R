# README

## Project Update:
* The current state of the project is the **Intro HTML** document (clone or pull, first)
* The current script is the **.Rmd** script in the [source repository directory](https://bitbucket.org/libjohn/devbb/src/244d0d799157791fd4f9dcc9dd10fe1f884fbaa7?at=master)
 * as of this writing that filename was "Intro-to-R_ver6.Rmd"
 * check timestamp for indicate of latest file

To run this Rmd

1. upload the .Rmd to docker
2. run in the console:  library(rmarkdown)
3. run in the console:  rebder("<latestFilename>.rmd"", output_file = 'Intro2R.html')
4. Then you should be able to run code-chunks rom the source pane.

* Remember, this is a **work in progress**.  And it needs a lot more progress
