## Intro2R Fall 2016: Data and Visualization Services Workshop
This is fork of the code/presentation developed by John Little and myself for presentation as part of the [Fall 2016 DVS Workshop Series](http://blogs.library.duke.edu/data/2016/08/24/data-visualization-services-fall-2016-workshop-series/).  While the workshop relied on Duke's virtual machine infrastructure, this repository adds some code designed for students working with R on their own machine.
